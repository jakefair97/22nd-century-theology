    <!--How I want to describe myself
    dear church, your theology is broken. signed, me-->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>I'm no expert, but I think today's theology is broken</h1>

        <!-- <p>For the first 20 years of my life, the most important thing someone could do was accept Jesus Christ as their personal lord and savior so that they could go to heaven when they die. Otherwise they’d be forced into hell and NO ONE wanted to go there. And I believed that whole-heartedly for the most part, except for some teenage rebellion mixed in there. </p>

        <p>Then one day something happened, something that shook this belief of mine to the core. It wasn’t that I met a genius atheist who could counter all the arguments for God’s existence, my church trained me up well to defend the faith. It wasn’t a tragedy that struck my life or a looming sense of doubt. It was by doing the one thing that everyone in my church told me to do.</p>

        <p>Y’all ready for this?</p>

        <p>I started seriously reading the bible. *cue the dramatic music*</p>

        <p>You read that right. More accurately I started to pay attention to what was really written in the text and I realized something: no one seems concerned about the personal salvation of the people around them, much less themselves. I was taught to ask questions that related to morality and how I could live my life “more Jesusly” if I let the bible speak this God-breathed word into my brain. But when I read the bible, this book seemed a lot less concerned about teaching me how to live a moral life and avoiding hell and more about telling a story, one epic narrative that led to Jesus as its climax. It was a crazy narrative that at times didn’t make sense and until I figured out what was going on with talking and flying snakes and plagues and pestilence, it wasn’t going to make any sense.</p>

        <p>But when I look around me, there isn’t much discussion about this. Church seems more about guiding you in how you’re supposed to feel than making sense of some of the bat shit crazy stuff that drives me to spend hours combing the web trying to understand how some of that stuff made it into this book. There’s a lot of discussion about how the bible is the word of God, but very little conversation about the actual humans to put pen to parchment. And quite frankly God seemed more like a tool to belittle my thoughts about the bible than a source of comfort.</p>

        <p>I’ve spent the past 3.5 years of my life wrestling with the tension of a God that I read about in this ancient text, a God who so many people around me see as a source of comfort and hope, and the god that I spent my entire college career fondling after and dealing with an aftermath of trauma that I still haven’t gotten past yet. And to put it bluntly, I haven’t found, read, heard, or seen a description of theology that I’m satisfied with. And this is why: people keep looking to the past for interpretations of the bible and I believe a lot of people get stuck there. But here’s the thing: they were writing to their audience in their time and in their place.</p>

        <p>So I’m here to reverse that. Instead of writing something that’s meant to be read in my own time, I want these thoughts to be intentionally written to a future generation, to a whole different century, who are still trying to figure this shit called theology figured out in their own time leaving a legacy for their next generation.</p> -->
