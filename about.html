        <h1>I'm no expert, but I think today's theology is broken</h1>

        <p>I mean think about it: the most important thing you can do in the span of your entire life is saying some magic words and having the right beliefs so that you won't be hot for all of eternity? How does this make sense to anybody? And more importantly if that's the most important thing why do we have thousands of books about how to say those words right when THE book these authors reference doesn't have these words explicitly written anywhere?</p>
            
        <p>This most important principle isn't going anywhere for some people and I think the problem is they're stuck in the past. This conclusion is based on some books written decades ago for a completely different audience and they're pretending it was written to them. They refuse to think for themselves in their own day because someone's already done it for them.</p>

        <p>So I’m here to reverse that. Instead of writing something that’s meant to be read in my own time that someone in the future will think is still meant for them, I want these thoughts to be intentionally written to a future generation, to a different century, who are still trying to figure this shit called theology figured out in their own time leaving a legacy for their next generation to build on, not cling onto.</p>
